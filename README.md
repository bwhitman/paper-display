## Parts needed

There's only a few parts you need to build this:

* A serial e-paper display. I am using a Waveshare 800x600 display, which you can get in a number of places. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-4-3inch-e-Paper-Resolution-Electronic/dp/B00VV5IMN0/) has them for $58 with Prime shipping.
* An ESP8266 board with pins broken out for serial and RST. I like the [Sparkfun Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231), it's $16 and works great. But the internet is riddled with these and you may already have something similar. 
* If your board needs it for programming and you don't already have one, a serial to USB connector. The Thing requires one, and [Sparkfun sells one that fits neatly on the board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873) for $15
* A li-po battery. I'm using [this 2000mAh one from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8483) ($13) but you can use almost anything. The 2000mAh should last over a year between charges. You may want to measure the thickness of the battery you want to make sure it fits in the frame.
* Some hookup wire (just one short one), solder, soldering iron, header pins if you need it for the serial programmer.
* A frame!
